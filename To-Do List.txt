Minecraft Item command


Needed:
Dungeon Stats
Fumings
Gemstones
Adding colour to description/lore/abilities in the game (currently only works on website)

Online Feature (and command)
Specific Gemstones (let users pick what gemstones to add)
custom stats
allow negative stats
Add a change-log within the site somewhere

find a way to split up description, lore and ability (without cutting mid word)

Ideas:
count characters, when character limit reached, split at next space.
search through description until you see \n, then split (user imputted line breaks?)
